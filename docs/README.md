# monger-infra Docs

This repo is the source of truth for homelab infrastructure configuration:

- `../docker/` – Docker/Portainer stack definitions (Unraid, desktop, PVE, etc.)
- `../k8s/` – Kubernetes manifests / Helm values (future)

Network maps and homelab documentation may continue to live in other repos (e.g. `spraycheese-assistant`) but can be referenced from here.
